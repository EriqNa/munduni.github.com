			<h2><font face="arial" color="white">Candidate's Manifesto</font></h2>
			
				<p>“One of the first things I’ll do as President will be to call the Prime Minister of Canada and the
President of Mexico and work with them to fix NAFTA. <br>We’ll add binding obligations to protect the
right to collective bargaining and other core labor standards recognized by the International Labor
Organization. <br>And I will add enforceable measures to NAFTA, the World Trade Organization (WTO),
CAFTA [Central America Free Trade Agreement] and other Free Trade Agreements (FTA’s) currently
in effect. <br>Similarly, we should add binding environmental standards so that companies from one
country cannot gain an economic advantage by destroying the environment. <br> And we should amend
NAFTA to make clear that fair laws and regulations written to protect citizens in any of the three
countries cannot be overridden simply at the request of foreign investors.”</p>
